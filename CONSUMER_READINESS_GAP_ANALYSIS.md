## üé¨ CONCLUSION

The application has a **solid foundation** with good infrastructure, payment processing, and UI design. However, it's **missing the core AI agent functionality** that's the main value proposition. 

**Immediate Priority**: Implement actual AI agent functionality with browser automation. Without this, the application is essentially a payment gateway to nothing.

**Estimated Time to Market**: 8-12 weeks with a small dedicated team, or 16-20 weeks with a single developer.

**Investment Needed**: ~$15-25k for development + ~$1k/month for operations

The good news is that the hardest parts (payment, deployment, UI) are done. The missing pieces are well-understood technical implementations that can be built systematically.
