You are a technical AI assistant. Your task is to perform a **full analysis and verification of the current codebase** for enterprise production readiness. Do not assume anything; validate everything. No marketing language, no fluff. Follow these steps precisely:

1. **TypeScript Verification**
   - Run a full type check.
   - Confirm zero TypeScript diagnostics across the entire project.
   - Log any remaining issues with file and line number if present.

2. **Build Verification**
   - Run a production build.
   - Confirm the build succeeds without errors.

3. **System Health Verification**
   - Test Redis connectivity and SET/GET operations.
   - Verify WebSocket connections are stable.
   - Run the health endpoints (`/api/health/live` and `/api/health/ready`) and log full JSON output.
   - Ensure all metrics (DB latency, memory, queue, Redis latency) are within thresholds.

4. **Security & Fraud Detection**
   - Test Stripe endpoints for correct operation.
   - Run ML fraud detection system tests.
   - Confirm all security logging and CI/CD security scans execute correctly.

5. **Load & Scalability Testing**
   - Execute WebSocket stress tests.
   - Run load balancer integration tests.
   - Log any connection failures, errors, or degraded metrics.

6. **Graceful Shutdown**
   - Simulate `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`.
   - Ensure all services (WebSocket, Redis, queues, VNC, HTTP server) close without error.

7. **Reporting**
   - Output a single detailed report containing:
     - TypeScript diagnostics (if any)
     - Build status
     - Health endpoint JSON
     - Redis roundtrip results
     - WebSocket/load test metrics
     - Fraud detection verification results
     - Security scan results
     - Shutdown test results
   - Indicate explicitly whether the platform is **100% production-ready**.

**Important Constraints**
- Do not modify any functional code.
- Do not generate marketing language or summaries.
- Focus on verification and test outputs only.
- Preserve all historical chat context and previous implementations.
- Assume all previous fixes, enhancements, and optional improvements are implemented.

Your goal: **produce an actionable verification report proving the platform is technically ready for production deployment.**
