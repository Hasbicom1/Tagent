CONTEXT & OBJECTIVE
You need to integrate AI browser automation capabilities into our web application. The solution must:

Be completely FREE to use/integrate
Support Computer Use Models (CPM) for autonomous browser control
Provide API/SDK integration for web app embedding
Handle full browser control (mouse, keyboard, navigation)
Execute natural language commands for web automation tasks

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Docker containerization support
REST API endpoints for web app communication
Python or Node.js SDK integration
Webhook support for async task completion
JSON response format for task results

INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE
Recommended Stack:
Frontend: Your Web App
↓ API Calls
Backend: Your Server
↓ Docker/SDK
Browser Agent: Browser-Use Container
↓ Browser Control
Target Websites: Automated Actions
API Integration Pattern:
python# Example integration with Browser-Use
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio

async def automate_task(instruction: str):
    agent = Agent(
        task=instruction,
        llm=your_llm_provider,  # OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    return result

# REST API endpoint
@app.post("/automate")
async def automation_endpoint(request: AutomationRequest):
    result = await automate_task(request.instruction)
    return {"success": True, "result": result}
NEXT STEPS

Start with Browser-Use - most mature and actively maintained
Set up Docker environment for isolated browser execution
Implement webhook system for async task completion
Test with simple automation tasks before complex workflows
Monitor performance and success rates for optimization
