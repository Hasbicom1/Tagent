COMPLETE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT & MONETIZATION ANALYSIS
MISSION: Conduct a comprehensive codebase analysis and provide step-by-step deployment instructions to get our system live and generating revenue through Stripe payments on our custom domain.
PHASE 1: COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE AUDIT
Please perform a complete analysis of our entire codebase and provide a detailed report covering:

Code Quality Assessment:

Scan all files for errors, warnings, and potential issues
Identify any missing dependencies or broken imports
Check for security vulnerabilities and exposed secrets
Verify all environment variables are properly configured


Functionality Verification:

Test all API endpoints and database connections
Verify frontend-backend communication
Check all user flows work end-to-end
Validate form submissions and data processing


Production Readiness Check:

Confirm all production environment variables are set
Verify SSL/HTTPS configurations
Check database migration status
Validate all third-party integrations



PHASE 2: SEQUENTIAL DEPLOYMENT ROADMAP
After confirming everything works, provide a detailed step-by-step deployment plan where EACH STEP MUST BE FULLY COMPLETED AND VERIFIED before proceeding to the next:
Step 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation

 Final code review and testing checklist
 Production database setup and migration
 Environment variables configuration
COMPLETION CRITERIA: All tests pass, no errors in logs

Step 2: Domain & Hosting Setup

 Domain configuration and DNS setup
 SSL certificate installation
 Server/hosting platform deployment
COMPLETION CRITERIA: Domain resolves correctly with HTTPS

Step 3: Application Deployment

 Deploy application to production server
 Configure reverse proxy/load balancer
 Set up monitoring and logging
COMPLETION CRITERIA: Application accessible via custom domain

Step 4: Stripe Payment Integration

 Stripe account setup and API key configuration
 Payment flow implementation and testing
 Webhook configuration for payment notifications
 Test transactions in Stripe test mode
COMPLETION CRITERIA: Successful test payments processed

Step 5: Go-Live Verification

 Switch Stripe to live mode
 Complete end-to-end user journey testing
 Verify payment processing works with real transactions
 Set up monitoring and alerts
COMPLETION CRITERIA: System processing real payments successfully

DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:

Detailed codebase analysis report with any issues found
Step-by-step deployment commands and configurations
Stripe integration guide with exact setup instructions
Domain configuration details
Post-deployment verification checklist
Emergency rollback procedures

SUCCESS METRICS:

Zero critical errors in production
Payment processing functional and secure
Application fully accessible via custom domain
Ready to generate revenue immediately

Please start with the comprehensive codebase analysis and only proceed to deployment planning after confirming everything is production-ready. Each deployment step should include verification commands to confirm completion before moving forward.
