## 🎯 CRITICAL QUESTIONS

**1. How many of the above AI agents did you actually implement?**
- All 35+ agents? 
- Just PHOENIX-7742 (your own system)?
- Only Playwright automation?

**2. Can users choose which AI agent to use?**
- Can they select Browser-Use for one task, Skyvern for another?
- Or do they only get PHOENIX-7742?

**3. Is there intelligent routing between multiple AI frameworks?**
- Does the system automatically use Skyvern for vision tasks, Browser-Use for general tasks, etc.?
- Or is it just one agent doing everything?

**4. Are ALL the frameworks above actually integrated and working?**
- Can you show code that imports and uses Browser-Use, Skyvern, LaVague, etc.?
- Or did you build one custom agent instead?

## 🚨 BE HONEST

**If you only implemented PHOENIX-7742 (your own browser automation system) and NOT all the AI agents we listed, just say so.**

**We want to know if we have:**
- ✅ **ALL 35+ AI agents integrated** (what we asked for)
- ❌ **Just one custom automation system** (not what we asked for)

**Please give us the honest answer about what's actually implemented.**
