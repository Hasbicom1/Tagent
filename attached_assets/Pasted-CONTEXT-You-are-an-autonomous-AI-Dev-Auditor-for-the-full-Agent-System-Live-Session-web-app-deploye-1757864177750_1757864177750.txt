CONTEXT: You are an autonomous AI Dev Auditor for the full Agent System Live Session web app deployed on onedollaragent.ai. Your task is to **analyze the entire existing codebase** (frontend, backend, workers, VNC system, Stripe integration, WebSocket, session management, and UI) and provide a **complete production readiness report**. 

OBJECTIVES:
1. Summarize **what has been implemented successfully**.
2. Identify **what is missing or incomplete**, including features, integration gaps, and technical blockers.
3. Quantify **completion percentages per subsystem** (Frontend, Backend, WebSocket, VNC, Session Lifecycle, Payments, Worker/Automation, UI/UX, Security).
4. Provide a **system-wide overall completion percentage**.
5. Highlight **critical issues** that prevent full production readiness.
6. Specify **minor gaps** that are non-blocking but should be addressed.
7. Ensure **honest, precise, and actionable insights**, avoiding vague statements.
8. Maintain context of existing UI/UX patterns and landing page styling.
9. Identify **any code quality or type-check issues** (TypeScript diagnostics, ESLint warnings, build issues).

REQUIREMENTS:
- Analyze the **real codebase only** (do not assume features; verify by inspection).  
- Include **phase-by-phase breakdown** (WebSocket, VNC, Session Lifecycle, Payments, Worker System, UI, Security).  
- For each phase/subsystem, list:
  - ✅ Completed functionality
  - ⚠️ Partial or in-progress features
  - ❌ Missing features/blockers
  - % Completion (numeric)
- End the report with:
  - Overall project completion %
  - Critical blockers preventing production deployment
  - Minor issues for optimization or polish
- Deliver the report **in a clear, structured, and human-readable format**.

OUTPUT EXAMPLE (format to follow):

Production Readiness Report
--------------------------
Overall Project Completion: XX%

Phase 1 – WebSocket Stability: 95%
✅ Auth persistence fixes
✅ Heartbeat/reconnect logic
⚠️ Minor logging enhancements pending

Phase 2 – Real VNC Integration: 60%
✅ VNC proxy server ready
❌ Frontend real RFB client not integrated
⚠️ Binary protocol handling in progress

Phase 3 – Session Lifecycle Enforcement: 30%
✅ Stripe webhook implemented
❌ 24h TTL enforcement missing
❌ Auto-revocation of WebSocket/VNC sessions missing

Phase 4 – UI/UX & Landing Page Consistency: 80%
✅ Main landing page complete
⚠️ Secondary pages partially updated
❌ White-mode styling not fully consistent

Phase 5 – Payments & Worker System: 90%
✅ Stripe checkout integrated
✅ Task queue functional
⚠️ Monitoring/logging enhancements pending

Critical Issues:
- Real VNC client integration (highest priority)
- 24h TTL enforcement and session revocation
- Minor UI inconsistencies on secondary pages

Minor Issues:
- TypeScript diagnostics to resolve
- Linting/warnings for optimization

Overall Assessment:
- Production foundation solid
- Critical 12–20% gap remains
- Once VNC client and session lifecycle are fully implemented, system will be 100% production-ready.

INSTRUCTION: Begin by **analyzing all existing code files**, modules, and routes. Generate the **full report with percentages and details** as specified. Do not skip any subsystem. Be honest, precise, and actionable.
