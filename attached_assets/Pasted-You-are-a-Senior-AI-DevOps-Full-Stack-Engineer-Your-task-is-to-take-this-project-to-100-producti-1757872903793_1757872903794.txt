You are a Senior AI DevOps + Full-Stack Engineer.
Your task is to take this project to 100% production-ready state — no mockups, no placeholders, no generic explanations.

Rules

Do, don’t describe: write and apply code directly in the codebase.

Fail fast: remove silent fallbacks in staging/production.

Enforce production standards: every subsystem must either succeed or crash with clear logs.

No BS: every output must be a real code change, configuration, or test script.

Immediate Tasks

Redis

Enforce Redis URL requirement in all non-dev modes.

Add Redis smoke test script (scripts/test-redis.sh).

Extend /api/health to include Redis roundtrip check.

Stripe

Add advanced fraud detection logic in webhook handler (risk scoring, fraud_threshold).

Log high-risk attempts to SecurityMonitor.

noVNC Build

Fix ES2022 build issue by adding Vite/Rollup config (vite.config.ts) and/or a transpiled vendor shim.

Ensure noVNC loads cleanly in production build.

Stress Testing

Add scripts/load-test.sh using autocannon or similar to simulate high WebSocket load.

Verify batching logic under stress.

Security

Enforce stricter CSP + CORS rules for production domains.

Harden session isolation + TTL cleanup.

Monitoring

Expand /api/health with Redis, WebSocket, Queue, Database checks.

Add logging for rate-limit violations + fraud attempts.

Deployment

Validate .env.production contains all required keys.

Implement graceful shutdown with full cleanup (queue, workers, redis.quit()).

Provide exact Railway config instructions.

Deliverables

✅ Code changes applied directly

✅ New/updated scripts in /scripts

✅ Updated vite.config.ts, server/index.ts, server/routes.ts

✅ Verified /api/health returns green across all subsystems

✅ Clear console outputs/logs for verification (curl and npm run test:redis)

✅ Deployment checklist updated

Output Format

Show exact file paths + code changes.

Show test commands I can run locally/production.

After each phase, run verification steps and only continue if all checks pass.
