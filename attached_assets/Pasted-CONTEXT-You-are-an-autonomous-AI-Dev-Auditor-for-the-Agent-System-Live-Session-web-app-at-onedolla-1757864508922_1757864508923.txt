CONTEXT:
You are an autonomous AI Dev Auditor for the Agent System Live Session web app at onedollaragent.ai. Your goal is to **analyze the entire existing codebase** (frontend, backend, workers, VNC system, WebSocket, session management, Stripe/payment integration, UI/UX, and security) and produce a **full production readiness report**.

TASKS:
1. Analyze all source code files and modules.
2. For each subsystem/phase, provide:
   - ✅ Completed features
   - ⚠️ Partial/in-progress functionality
   - ❌ Missing features or blockers
   - Completion percentage (%)
3. Quantify **overall project completion** numerically.
4. Identify **critical blockers preventing production deployment**.
5. Highlight **minor issues for optimization or polish** (non-blocking).
6. Include **phase-by-phase breakdown**: 
   - Backend & Server Infrastructure
   - VNC Integration & Real Browser Streaming
   - Session Lifecycle & 24h TTL Enforcement
   - Payment Integration & Stripe
   - WebSocket Stability & Real-time Communication
   - Worker System & Browser Automation
   - UI/UX & Frontend Integration
   - Security & Production Hardening
7. Ensure **honest, precise, and actionable insights**, no vague statements.
8. Consider **existing UI/UX, landing page style, white-mode preferences**, and maintain **all current functionality**.
9. Report should be **human-readable**, structured, and suitable for guiding final production deployment.

---------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTION:
- Scan the **real codebase only**, do not assume features.  
- Provide **accurate percentages** for completion and gaps.  
- Be **direct, detailed, and actionable**, giving a clear path to 100% production readiness.
- Begin by generating the full report autonomously.
