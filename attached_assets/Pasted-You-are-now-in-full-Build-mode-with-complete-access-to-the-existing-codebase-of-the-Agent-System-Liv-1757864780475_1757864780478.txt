You are now in full Build mode with complete access to the existing codebase of the Agent System Live Session web app (onedollaragent.ai). Your objective is to autonomously implement **all remaining production-critical fixes** and polish tasks to reach **100% production readiness**, without breaking any current functionality, UI pages, or business logic. 

Use only the existing codebase. No mocks, placeholders, or workarounds are allowed. All updates must be fully production-grade and tested.

### **Critical Tasks to Complete**

1️⃣ **Resolve TypeScript Diagnostics**
- Fix all 21 LSP errors across these files:
  - `vnc-proxy.ts` (security event type mismatches)
  - `vnc-loader.ts` (CDN module import declarations)
  - `server/index.ts` (Redis null type issue)
  - `routes.ts` (Stripe API version type)
- Ensure code compiles cleanly under ES2022/ESNext for frontend and backend.
- Validate type correctness across all endpoints, WebSocket handlers, and VNC proxy logic.

2️⃣ **Validate & Complete Real VNC Streaming**
- Replace any remaining ProductionRFB or simulated VNC loaders with real `@novnc/novnc` RFB client.  
- Ensure full browser streaming with:
  - Real-time mouse & keyboard input  
  - 10fps at 1280×720 resolution  
  - Automatic reconnect logic  
- Integrate seamlessly with existing VNC WebSocket proxy (`server/vnc-proxy.ts`) and `VNCManager` backend.  
- Confirm security compliance: JWT authentication, cookie-based browser auth, origin validation, rate limiting.

3️⃣ **Enhance Session Lifecycle Enforcement**
- Verify 24-hour TTL is enforced across all API endpoints.
- Ensure **automatic cascade revocation**:
  - WebSocket connections  
  - VNC sessions  
- Confirm session regeneration and activity tracking remain intact.

4️⃣ **Optional Production Polish & Performance**
- Tune WebSocket connection pooling and heartbeat intervals for high throughput.
- Optimize BullMQ task batching and worker resource monitoring.
- Confirm all health check endpoints (`/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`) report accurate status.

5️⃣ **Maintain UI/UX Integrity**
- All current pages and features must remain functional.
- Frontend VNC client and test interfaces must preserve styling, theme support, and landing page design.
- Ensure **white mode** is applied across all pages.
- Any new UI components must follow **landing-page-inspired interaction patterns**.

6️⃣ **Validation & Testing**
- End-to-end testing with live TigerVNC backend:
  - Stripe $1 checkout → session creation → WebSocket stable connection → real VNC streaming → session expiry.
- Confirm browser console and server logs are error-free.
- Validate CDN runtime integrity pinning for production security.
- Document all changes with clear commit messages.

### **Execution Instructions**
- Complete each task fully before moving to the next.
- Summarize completion at the end of each phase with:  
  `"Phase X complete – verified production readiness."`
- After all tasks are complete, provide a **full Production Readiness Report** including:
  - Overall % completion  
  - Achievements and improvements  
  - Any minor remaining optimization opportunities

### **Success Criteria**
✅ Code compiles with zero TypeScript errors  
✅ Real VNC streaming fully functional in-browser  
✅ WebSocket connections stable and authenticated  
✅ Stripe payments and session lifecycle fully enforced  
✅ All UI/UX components maintain current design and theme  
✅ End-to-end production tests pass without errors  

Begin execution immediately and achieve **100% production readiness**.
