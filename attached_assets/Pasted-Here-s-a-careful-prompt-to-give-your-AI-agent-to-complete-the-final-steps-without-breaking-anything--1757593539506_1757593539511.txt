Here's a careful prompt to give your AI agent to complete the final steps without breaking anything:

🎯 FINAL PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT - CAREFUL COMPLETION PHASE
MISSION: Complete the remaining 8% of minor issues and guide step-by-step deployment to live domain with Stripe monetization - WITHOUT BREAKING ANY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY.
⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY RULES:

Make ONLY the specific fixes listed below
Test each change immediately after making it
Do NOT modify any working payment, security, or core systems
If ANY step causes errors, STOP and report the issue immediately


PHASE 1: COMPLETE REMAINING MINOR FIXES (15 minutes)
Fix 1: Add Health Check Endpoint
javascript// Add this EXACT code to your Express server (app.js or server.js)
app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    status: 'healthy', 
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    version: '1.0.0'
  });
});
VERIFY: Test GET /api/health returns 200 OK
Fix 2: Update CORS Configuration
javascript// Update ALLOWED_ORIGINS in your environment config
// Add your Railway app URL (you'll get this during deployment)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.com,https://your-app-name.railway.app"
Fix 3: Fix TypeScript Diagnostic

Check server/storage.ts for any TypeScript warnings
Fix only if it's a simple type annotation issue
DO NOT refactor or change logic

VERIFICATION CHECKPOINT:

 All existing tests still pass
 Payment system still works (test create-checkout-session)
 No new errors in console
