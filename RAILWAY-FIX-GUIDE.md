# 🚀 RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX - MISSING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

## ❌ **CURRENT ERROR:**
```
❌ DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED: Missing required environment variables:
  - VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY: Stripe publishable key (pk_test_... or pk_live_...)
  - FRONTEND_URL: Production frontend URL (https://... only)
```

## 🔧 **STEP-BY-STEP FIX:**

### **STEP 1: Add Missing Environment Variables to Railway**

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Select your project: `fe7d619b-872a-4938-83fc-33f5e3f7366e`

2. **Navigate to Variables:**
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Click "New Variable" for each missing variable

### **STEP 2: Add VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY**

**Variable Name:** `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
**Variable Value:** Your Stripe publishable key

**To get your Stripe key:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
3. Add it to Railway as `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`

**Example:**
```
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_51ABC123...your-actual-key-here
```

### **STEP 3: Add FRONTEND_URL**

**Variable Name:** `FRONTEND_URL`
**Variable Value:** Your production domain

**Set to your Railway domain:**
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

**OR if you have a custom domain:**
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://www.onedollaragent.ai
```

### **STEP 4: Redeploy**

After adding both variables:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## ✅ **VERIFICATION:**

After adding the variables, your Railway logs should show:
```
✅ STRIPE: Payment gateway initialized successfully
✅ SECURITY: Environment validation passed
🚀 Server running on port 5000
```

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **If VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY is wrong:**
- Make sure it starts with `pk_test_` (for testing) or `pk_live_` (for production)
- Get the correct key from Stripe Dashboard > API Keys

### **If FRONTEND_URL is wrong:**
- Must start with `https://`
- Use your Railway domain: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- Or your custom domain: `https://www.onedollaragent.ai`

### **If deployment still fails:**
- Check Railway logs for new error messages
- Verify all variables are set correctly
- Make sure there are no typos in variable names

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULT:**

After fixing these 2 variables, your deployment should succeed and you'll see:
- ✅ All environment variables validated
- ✅ Server starting successfully
- ✅ Application accessible via Railway URL

## 📞 **NEED HELP?**

If you're still having issues:
1. Check Railway logs for any new error messages
2. Verify all 10 required variables are set
3. Make sure variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
