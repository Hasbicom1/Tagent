## üéß **CUSTOMER SUPPORT MASTERY**

### **Common Customer Questions & Responses**

**Q: "I paid $1 but can't access my agent"**
**A**: "Thanks for reaching out! Let me check your payment status. Can you provide the email address you used for payment? I'll have this resolved within 15 minutes."
*Action: Check Stripe dashboard for payment, verify agent activation*

**Q: "How do I use the AI agent?"**
**A**: "Great question! After payment, you'll see an agent interface where you can type any task you want automated. For example: 'Find 10 competitors for my restaurant' or 'Research trending topics in my industry.' The agent will work on it live while you watch!"

**Q: "Is this a subscription or one-time payment?"**
**A**: "It's a simple one-time $1 payment for 24 hours of AI agent access. No recurring charges, no hidden fees. After 24 hours, if you want more access, just pay another $1!"

**Q: "How is this different from ChatGPT?"**
**A**: "ChatGPT just gives you text answers. Our AI agent actually performs live browser automation - it can research competitors, fill out forms, gather data, and complete complex multi-step tasks. Plus at $1 vs $20/month, it's 20x more affordable!"

**Q: "What can the agent actually do?"**
**A**: "The agent can browse websites, research information, fill forms, gather contact details, analyze competitors, find business opportunities, automate social media research, and much more. Think of it as a personal assistant that works 24/7 for just $1!"
