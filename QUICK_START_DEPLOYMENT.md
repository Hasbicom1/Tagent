## 🎯 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Fork & Deploy** ⏱️ 10 minutes

**1.1. Fork the Repository**
```bash
# Go to the Agent HQ GitHub repository
# Click "Fork" in the top right
# This creates your own copy of the code
```

**1.2. Deploy to Railway**
```bash
# In your terminal (or use Railway web interface):
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/agent-hq.git
cd agent-hq
./scripts/deploy-to-railway.sh
```

**What this does automatically:**
- ✅ Creates Railway project
- ✅ Adds PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Adds Redis cache
- ✅ Deploys your application
- ✅ Generates secure secrets
- ✅ Provides Railway URL

**Expected Result**: Your Agent HQ is live at a Railway URL (like `agent-hq-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)

### **Step 2: Add API Keys** ⏱️ 5 minutes

**2.1. Open Railway Dashboard**
- Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Click on your "agent-hq" project
- Click on the service name
- Go to "Variables" tab

**2.2. Add Your API Keys**
```bash
# Click "New Variable" and add each one:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = sk_live_your_actual_stripe_key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = pk_live_your_actual_public_key  
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-proj-your_actual_openai_key
```

**Expected Result**: Railway automatically redeploys with your API keys

---

### **Step 3: Test Your Deployment** ⏱️ 5 minutes

**3.1. Visit Your App**
- Go to your Railway URL
- You should see the Agent HQ homepage

### **Step 4: Add Custom Domain (Optional)** ⏱️ 15 minutes

**4.1. Add Domain to Railway**
```bash
# In your project directory:
./scripts/setup-domain.sh yourdomain.com
```

**4.2. Update DNS (Manual step)**
- Log into your domain provider (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
- Add the CNAME records shown by the script
- Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation

**Expected Result**: Your Agent HQ is live at your custom domain with SSL

---

### **Step 5: Validate Everything** ⏱️ 5 minutes

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

```bash
# Check Railway logs:
railway logs
# Look for environment variable errors
```

**❓ Payment not working**
```bash
# Verify in Railway dashboard:
# - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY starts with sk_live_ (not sk_test_)
# - VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY starts with pk_live_ (not pk_test_)
```

**❓ AI agent not responding**
```bash
# Check OpenAI API key:
# - Key is valid and has credits
# - Key starts with sk-proj- (recommended) or sk-
```

**❓ Domain not working**
```bash
# Check DNS propagation:
./verify-domain.sh
# DNS can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate
```

**❓ Database errors**
```bash
# Railway automatically provides DATABASE_URL
# Check in Railway dashboard under "Variables"
# Should start with postgresql://
```

### **Getting Help**

1. **Railway Issues**: Railway dashboard has 24/7 chat support
2. **Code Issues**: Create GitHub issue in your forked repository
