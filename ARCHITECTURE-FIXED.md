# ‚úÖ CORRECT ARCHITECTURE - GROQ AS ORCHESTRATOR

## THE RIGHT FLOW (NOW IMPLEMENTED)

```
User types: "go to google"
       ‚Üì
Groq (AI Brain) analyzes the request
       ‚Üì
Groq outputs: "I'll navigate to Google for you. <COMMAND>{"action": "navigate", "target": "https://google.com"}</COMMAND>"
       ‚Üì
Backend extracts the <COMMAND> JSON
       ‚Üì
Backend sends command to Worker Agent (via Redis or HTTP)
       ‚Üì
Worker Agent (Playwright + VNC):
  - Launches browser
  - Navigates to google.com
  - Streams live video via VNC
       ‚Üì
User sees: Live browser + Groq's chat message
```

## WHAT WAS FIXED (commit 216b6d4)

### Before (WRONG):
- Groq asked: "Should I execute this?" (waiting for confirmation)
- Backend detected keywords like "navigate" (dumb pattern matching)
- Worker never got proper commands

### After (RIGHT):
- Groq **immediately** generates `<COMMAND>` tags when it detects browser tasks
- Backend **extracts** the command from Groq's response
- Worker **executes** the structured command
- VNC **streams** live browser to user

## GROQ'S NEW SYSTEM PROMPT

```
You are an AI orchestrator that generates commands for a browser automation system.
When users request web tasks, you IMMEDIATELY generate a <COMMAND> tag with JSON instructions.

YOUR JOB:
1. Detect when users want browser automation (navigate, search, click, type, screenshot, etc.)
2. IMMEDIATELY output a <COMMAND> tag with JSON - don't ask for confirmation
3. Also provide a friendly message explaining what you're doing

COMMAND FORMAT:
<COMMAND>{"action": "navigate|search|click|type|screenshot", "target": "url or query", "description": "brief description"}</COMMAND>
```

## EXAMPLES OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR

### Example 1: Navigation
```
User: "go to youtube"
Groq: "Opening YouTube for you. <COMMAND>{"action": "navigate", "target": "https://youtube.com", "description": "Navigating to YouTube"}</COMMAND>"
‚Üí Worker opens YouTube in browser
‚Üí User sees live stream via VNC
```

### Example 2: Search
```
User: "search for iPhone 15"
Groq: "I'll search Google for iPhone 15. <COMMAND>{"action": "search", "target": "iPhone 15", "description": "Searching for iPhone 15"}</COMMAND>"
‚Üí Worker searches Google
‚Üí User sees live search results
```

### Example 3: Normal Chat (No Browser Task)
```
User: "hello"
Groq: "Hello! I can help you browse the web. Just tell me what you'd like to do."
‚Üí No <COMMAND> tag
‚Üí Just chat, no automation
```

## BACKEND COMMAND EXTRACTION

Located in `server/production.js` (lines 617-636):

```javascript
const fullResponse = groqData?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content?.trim() || null;

// Extract browser command if present
const commandMatch = fullResponse?.match(/<COMMAND>(.*?)<\/COMMAND>/);
if (commandMatch) {
  browserCommand = JSON.parse(commandMatch[1]);
  console.log('üéØ Browser command extracted:', browserCommand);
  // Remove command tags from user-facing message
  aiText = fullResponse.replace(/<COMMAND>.*?<\/COMMAND>/, '').trim();
}
```

## WORKER ROUTING

Located in `server/production.js` (lines 660-703):

1. **Redis Queue (Primary)**
   ```javascript
   if (isQueueAvailable()) {
     const queueResult = await queueBrowserTask(
       JSON.stringify(browserCommand),
       sessionId,
       agentId
     );
     taskId = queueResult.taskId;
   }
   ```

2. **HTTP Fallback (If Redis unavailable)**
   ```javascript
   const workerUrl = process.env.WORKER_INTERNAL_URL || 'http://worker.railway.internal:8080';
   const workerResponse = await fetch(`${workerUrl}/task`, {
     method: 'POST',
     body: JSON.stringify({
       instruction: browserCommand,
       sessionId: sessionId,
       agentId: agentId
     })
   });
   ```

## REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

### Tagent Service (Main App)
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxx...
WORKER_INTERNAL_URL=http://worker.railway.internal:8080
REDIS_URL=redis://default:xxx@xxx.railway.internal:6379  # Optional but recommended
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://xxx...  # Required for session persistence
```

### Worker Service
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
REDIS_URL=redis://default:xxx@xxx.railway.internal:6379  # Same as Tagent
```

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After Railway deploys this commit:

1. **Test Chat**
   - Go to: `https://your-app.railway.app/live/agent/{your-session-id}`
   - Type: "hello"
   - Expected: Groq responds normally (no command)

2. **Test Navigation**
   - Type: "go to google"
   - Expected:
     - Groq says: "I'll navigate to Google for you. <COMMAND>..."
     - Backend extracts command
     - Worker executes
     - VNC panel shows live browser opening google.com

3. **Test Search**
   - Type: "search for cats"
   - Expected:
     - Groq says: "I'll search Google for cats. <COMMAND>..."
     - Backend extracts command
     - Worker searches
     - VNC panel shows live search results

4. **Check Logs**
   - Backend should show:
     ```
     ü§ñ AI: Calling Groq (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) - Agent Brain
     ‚úÖ AI: Groq responded in XXXms
     üéØ Browser command extracted: {"action":"navigate","target":"https://google.com"}
     üìã Using Redis queue for task distribution
     ‚úÖ Task queued to Redis: task_xxx
     ```
   - Worker should show:
     ```
     üì• Processing task: task_xxx
     üåê Browser action: navigate
     ‚úÖ Task completed successfully
     ```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Commands Not Detected
- Check: Groq logs show `üéØ Browser command extracted`
- If NO: Groq isn't outputting `<COMMAND>` tags correctly
- Solution: Check Groq API logs, verify system prompt is active

### If Worker Not Responding
- Check: `WORKER_INTERNAL_URL` is set correctly
- Check: Private networking enabled for both services
- Check: Worker service is running (health check passing)

### If VNC Not Streaming
- Check: Worker logs show VNC server started
- Check: Frontend VNC panel is making WebSocket connections
- Check: `/vnc/:sessionId` endpoint returns 200

## COST BREAKDOWN

- **Tagent**: ~$5/month (Railway, Nixpacks)
- **Worker**: ~$5/month (Railway, Docker)
- **Redis**: ~$10/month (Railway managed)
- **Total**: ~$20/month

If you want to stay at $5/month:
- Option 1: Remove Redis, use HTTP fallback only (less reliable)
- Option 2: Use single-service architecture (simpler, but no VNC live view)

---

## SUMMARY

‚úÖ **Groq is now the REAL orchestrator** - it analyzes user requests and generates structured commands
‚úÖ **Backend extracts commands** - no more dumb keyword detection
‚úÖ **Worker executes commands** - proper Playwright automation with VNC
‚úÖ **User sees live browser** - via VNC streaming in frontend

**THIS IS THE CORRECT ARCHITECTURE YOU REQUESTED.**
