**Supporting Colors:**
- Success: Electric green (120 100% 60%) for successful operations
- Warning: Bright amber (45 100% 65%) for system alerts
- Error: Vivid red (0 85% 60%) for critical errors

- Interface text: 400-500 weight optimized for dark backgrounds
- Terminal text: 400 weight monospace with subtle glow effects

### Layout System
**Spacing Primitives:** Tailwind units of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16
- Terminal-inspired grid with emphasis on horizontal rhythm
- Generous padding (8-16 units) for breathing room
- Dense information areas use 4-unit spacing for efficiency

### Component Library

**Navigation:**
- VS Code-inspired sidebar with file tree aesthetics
- Terminal-style top bar with command palette integration
- Breadcrumbs styled as file paths with forward slashes

**Terminal Interface:**
- Full-screen terminal windows with subtle rounded corners
- Monospace text with syntax highlighting
- Cursor animations and typing effects for live feedback
- Command history with up/down arrow navigation

**Dashboard Elements:**
- Dark cards with subtle border glows
- Real-time status indicators with pulsing animations
- Progress bars with electric blue fills and terminal-style percentages
- Live browser preview in terminal-framed windows

**Professional Controls:**

### Key Design Principles
1. **Advanced Technology Feel**: Dark themes with electric accents create cutting-edge atmosphere
2. **Terminal Aesthetics**: Monospace fonts and command-line interfaces throughout
3. **Professional Polish**: iOS-quality animations and VS Code-inspired layouts
4. **Psychological Impact**: Subtle glows and gradients enhance the futuristic feel
5. **Developer-Grade UX**: Keyboard-first navigation with power-user shortcuts

### Animations
**Subtle Enhancements Only:**
- Gentle cursor blinking in terminal areas
- Smooth fade transitions between states
- Soft glow effects on interactive elements
- Minimal slide animations for modals and dropdowns

### Images
**No Hero Image**: Replace with full-width terminal interface showing live agent execution
**Inline Screenshots**: Small terminal windows displaying agent workflows, styled as code editor tabs
**Interface Previews**: Browser automation views framed as terminal outputs with subtle glows

Focus on functional interface screenshots that demonstrate platform capabilities within the terminal aesthetic framework.
